# INSEA Alumni LinkedIn Scraper
This project is a LinkedIn scraper that extracts data on alumni from the Institut National de Statistique et d'Economie Appliquee (INSEA). Using the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python, the scraper collects information such as alumni names, current companies, and locations from LinkedIn profiles. The resulting dataset can be used for further analysis to gain insights into the career paths of INSEA graduates.
Scrapes INSEA alumni data from LinkedIn profiles using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, providing a dataset for analysis.

# Purpose
The original purpose of this project was to gather data on INSEA alumni for the INSEA IT Club to contact and seek sponsorships. However, the resulting dataset can also be used for academic research, career counseling, and other purposes.

# Important notes
- The INSEA_Alumni.csv file provided does not contain the names of alumni for privacy reasons.
- The code provided scrapes only 20 profiles due to LinkedIn's daily limit of 80 profile views per day.
- If you are a student at INSEA and would like access to the full dataset of 200 alumni profiles, please contact me on my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasir-ech-chammakhy/.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- ChromeDriver (or another WebDriver)

# Further Analysis
The dataset generated by the scraper can be used for further analysis, such as identifying the most common industries where INSEA alumni work, their job titles, or their career trajectories. This information can be useful for students and job seekers interested in pursuing similar career paths.
